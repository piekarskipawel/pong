I wrote a Pong Game that was originally released for 1972 Atari Computers.  I used Pygame libary to write the game.

Player 1's controls are the W and S keys.
Player 2's controls are the UP and DOWN keys.

SPACE key launches the game and the next game.

Running the game requires the installation of Pygame.

pip install pygame

In the settings.py file, you can control speed of the ball and paddles.
