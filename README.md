I wrote a Pong game inspired by the original 1972 release for Atari computers. I used the Pygame library to develop the game.

Player 1 controls the paddle using the W and S keys, while Player 2 uses the UP and DOWN arrow keys.

Press the SPACE key to launch the game and start the next round.

The game requires Pygame to be installed:

pip install pygame

In the settings.py file, you can adjust the speed of the ball and paddles.
